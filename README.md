# mysql-http-proxy
A simple HTTP proxy for MySQL, designed for serverless environments like Cloudflare Workers.

### ðŸ˜” The Problem
Serverless environments such as AWS Lambda are not suited for database connections. Traditional databases such as MySQL can be easily slowed to a crawl by handling too many connections; plus, as of March 2022, Cloudflare Workers don't even support TCP which relation databases require!

### ðŸŽ‰ The Solution
Enter `mysql-http-proxy`. It sits on a server and acts as a super-simple database proxy, exposing an HTTP endpoint and ensuring only one connection is ever open to your database at once.

### ðŸ¤” How to Use
Spin up a server anywhere you desire. Clone the repo, rename the `.env.template` file to `.env` and modify your MySQL endpoint. Run `npm run start` and away you go! ðŸš€

Run a query to `http://endpoint:3001/query` with a body of:
```javascript
{
  "query": "YOUR_REGULAR_SQL_QUERY_HERE"
}
```

Your response will be either:
```javascript
{
  "error": "Descriptive error message."
}
```
or the response to your SQL query in JSON.
